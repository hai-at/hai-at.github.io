          <h2 class="subtitle"> We work on interactive machine learning techniques, immersive and visual analytics, and AI-driven computer user interface methods that promote mutual understanding and cooperation between humans and AI. For this to succeed, both humans and AI must be able to communicate with each other, provide feedback, and act on that knowledge. The result for us is the use of an AI that enables fluid cooperation between humans and machines and gives us the freedom to use our human strength of genuine creativity.</h2>

		  <p>
The aim is to develop explainable algorithms and to offer the user methods for interpreting the learning processes and reasoning of the AI. Explainable AI plays a key role in AI trustworthiness and acceptance. Research focuses on algorithms for calculating explainable features, methods for validating and analysing them, and methods for explaining these features in an understandable form.

		  <p>
Our goal is to develop intelligent systems that can "reflect" their actions in relation to human perception, intentions and other contextual factors. We are interested in collecting data and generating data-driven models to understand what the affective and emotional state of people in different interactions with technology looks like and how it influences the interaction. Such systems are designed to adapt to different human states while creating models of human intentions and behaviors.

		  <h2 class="subtitle">Motivation</h2>
		  <p>
		    The considerable sums being invested in digitization are leading to complex “cyberphysical systems”. Still, despite recent advances, the sensory experience offered by immersive technologies is rather limited. Data is available, but access, interaction, and analysis are separate from the physical entity. These are tedious activities when done in the physical world. Visualization and interaction metaphors and analysis methods were simply not developed to represent a physical world.
		     So, how should information about physically and digitally existing entities best be combined in a coherent presentation?

		<div class="txt">
		  <hr class="content-divider">
		  <h2 class="subtitle">Objectives</h2>
		  <p>
		    The goal is to provide personalized experiences with data and analytics anchored in the real world – for the individual participant or together with peers locally or remotely. We do so by:<br/>

i- Exploring models of embodied interaction with immersive analytics. <br/>

ii- Developing paradigms for collaborative immersive remote analysis. <br/>

iii- Exploring personalization based on physiological sensing and social immersive training.<br/>

In a nutshell, we investigate how to present and interact with immersive data views, what physiological features lead to perceptual optimization and personalization, and how to use traces of interactions in the environment to create recommendations and guidance.

		  <h2 class="subtitle">A holistic approach to your own Ai</h2>
		  <p>

		    In the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, businesses are increasingly recognizing the importance of integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) into their operations. With the overarching goal of aligning AI models with specific business requirements, we set forth comprehensive objectives and a strategic approach to create a robust framework for the deployment and development of our own AI models. 
		  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="txt">
		  <hr class="content-divider">
		  <h2 class="subtitle">Objectives</h2>
		  <p>
		    The primary objective of our initiative is to establish a framework that facilitates the seamless deployment of AI models, ensuring they are in harmony with the unique requirements of your business. This involves a meticulous process of research and development to not only create AI models but also to continually enhance their learning capabilities while retaining past knowledge. The dynamic nature of the field necessitates a proactive approach to research and development, which includes methods to interactively steer the AI based on evolving circumstances. 
		  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="txt">
		  <hr class="content-divider">
		  <h2 class="subtitle">Approach</h2>
		  <p>

Our approach is rooted in the principles of collaborative co-creation, emphasizing close collaboration with stakeholders to gain a deep understanding of the challenges they face. By actively involving stakeholders in the development process, we ensure that the resulting AI models are tailored to meet specific business requirements. This collaborative co-creation not only enhances the relevance of the AI models but also fosters a sense of ownership among stakeholders. 

A key aspect of our approach is the development of tailored solutions that are finely tuned to align with the specific nuances of our business requirements. This involves an intricate process of research and development, where AI models are crafted to address the unique challenges and objectives of the organization. The goal is not just to deploy AI for the sake of technology but to create solutions that bring tangible value and efficiency to our operations. 

Furthermore, we are committed to incorporating human agency and responsible AI practices into the core of our development process. This entails embedding essential values and ethics into the AI models to ensure their responsible and ethical use. To enhance transparency and accountability, we provide explainable interactive techniques, allowing users to understand and steer the AI's decision-making processes.
