          <h2 class="subtitle"> We work on interactive machine learning techniques, immersive and visual analytics, and AI-driven computer user interface methods that promote mutual understanding and cooperation between humans and AI. For this to succeed, both humans and AI must be able to communicate with each other, provide feedback, and act on that knowledge. The result for us is the use of an AI that enables fluid cooperation between humans and machines and gives us the freedom to use our human strength of genuine creativity.</h2>

		  <p>
The aim is to develop explainable algorithms and to offer the user methods for interpreting the learning processes and reasoning of the AI. Explainable AI plays a key role in AI trustworthiness and acceptance. Research focuses on algorithms for calculating explainable features, methods for validating and analysing them, and methods for explaining these features in an understandable form.

		  <p>
Our goal is to develop intelligent systems that can "reflect" their actions in relation to human perception, intentions and other contextual factors. We are interested in collecting data and generating data-driven models to understand what the affective and emotional state of people in different interactions with technology looks like and how it influences the interaction. Such systems are designed to adapt to different human states while creating models of human intentions and behaviors.

		  <h2 class="subtitle">Motivation</h2>
		  <p>
		    The considerable sums being invested in digitization are leading to complex “cyberphysical systems”. Still, despite recent advances, the sensory experience offered by immersive technologies is rather limited. Data is available, but access, interaction, and analysis are separate from the physical entity. These are tedious activities when done in the physical world. Visualization and interaction metaphors and analysis methods were simply not developed to represent a physical world.
		     So, how should information about physically and digitally existing entities best be combined in a coherent presentation?
		  </p>
		</div>

		<div class="txt">
		  <hr class="content-divider">
		  <h2 class="subtitle">Objectives</h2>
		  <p>
		    The goal is to provide personalized experiences with data and analytics anchored in the real world – for the individual participant or together with peers locally or remotely. We do so by:<br/>

i- Exploring models of embodied interaction with immersive analytics. <br/>

ii- Developing paradigms for collaborative immersive remote analysis. <br/>

iii- Exploring personalization based on physiological sensing and social immersive training.<br/>

In a nutshell, we investigate how to present and interact with immersive data views, what physiological features lead to perceptual optimization and personalization, and how to use traces of interactions in the environment to create recommendations and guidance.
